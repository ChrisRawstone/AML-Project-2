Questions for TA support:
1. Should we expect to see constant speed geodesics?
2. What is the correct way of using the decoder ensemble for computing curve lengths?
    Should we decoder the latent curve with all ensemble members and average their outputs?
    Or should we sample one of the decoders and only use this?
3. What's the correct way of training the ensemble VAE's? We recall SÃ¸ren saying that, for each batch 
    we should sample a decoder and compute the ELBO w.r.t this and train it in that fashion. 
4. What are good measures of gauging geodesic behavior?
5. Can we expect the minimized energies to equal the squared curve lengths? 
    Currently, we observe that we get energies way below our squared curve lengths
6. How should we interpret latent variable pairs?
